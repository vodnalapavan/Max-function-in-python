In Python, the max() function is used to find the maximum element in an iterable. When applied to a list of tuples,
 max() can be used to find the tuple with the highest value based on a specified criterion.

By default, if you apply max() to a list of tuples without any additional parameters,
 it will compare the tuples based on the first element of each tuple. Here's an example:

tuples_list = [(1, 'apple'), (3, 'banana'), (2, 'cherry')]
result = max(tuples_list)
print(result)  # Output will be (3, 'banana')
In this example, max(tuples_list) returns the tuple (3, 'banana') because 3 is the highest value among the first elements of all tuples (1, 3, 2).

If you want to find the maximum based on the second element of each tuple or any other criterion, you can use the key parameter. 
The key parameter expects a function that extracts a comparison key from each element in the iterable. Here's an example:

tuples_list = [(1, 'apple'), (3, 'banana'), (2, 'cherry')]
result = max(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1])
print(result)  # Output will be (3, 'banana') or (2, 'cherry') depending on the lexicographical order
In this example, max(tuples_list, key=lambda x: x[1]) returns the tuple with the lexicographically greatest string in the second position. The lambda function lambda x: x[1] takes each tuple x and returns its second element x[1] for comparison. The output will be either (3, 'banana') or (2, 'cherry'), depending on the lexicographical order of the strings 'banana' and 'cherry'.
